        Based in Milwaukee Wisconsin, Ari Dinan is an interdisciplinary artist with a primary focus in textiles,
        fashion, ink, collage, and music. Ari has had a passion for the environment from a very young age, and involves 
        themes of sustainability in much of his work, like his current project, "The Time Brick," which he hopes
        will create new expansions on affordable housing and plastic waste collection in his community.
        As a high school student at Reagan, Ari hopes to one day pursue art in harmony with environmental defense law.
        Currently, he spends most of his time sewing, writing, and making music with his rock band, Wonderbubble.
